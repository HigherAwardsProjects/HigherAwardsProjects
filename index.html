<p>The Girl Scout Higher Awards Projects are larger projects that require a girl to make an impact on the world.  Journey Awards are available at every level starting with Brownies.  The Bronze Award is available to Junior Girl Scouts, the Silver Award is available to Girl Scout Cadettes, and the Gold Award is available to Senior and Ambassador Girl Scouts.  <br><br>
  
  Service Unit 404 is part of the Greater Chicago and Northwest Indiana Girl Scout Council.  This website was designed to showcase the Higher Awards Projects done by Girl Scouts in our Service Unit.<br><br>

     Cadette "MEdia" Journey, May 2024<br>
      Valerie H, Troop 47307
    </div>
   <div class="projecttext">
    I learned about media consumption, advertising methods, and stereotypes in media.  My original plan was to put up a poster about stereotypes in movies, but I had trouble finding somewhere to display it and get people involved, so I worked to help create a website for our service unit so that other girl scouts will be able to have a place to display their Higher Award projects.

     Bronze Award - "Plastic Bag Project" - May 2024<br>
      Honor H and Emilia D, Troop 47307
    </div>
   <div class="projecttext">
    This project was about helping people cut down on the usage of plastic bags.  We learned about the harm that plastic bags can cause to our environment, attended a local park cleanup, hosted a booth at the Earth Day expo in Park Ridge, and organized a plastic bag recycling drive at our school, recycling 28 pounds of plastic bags - almost 2000 plastic bags!<br><br>

     Junior "Get Moving" Journey, Dec 2023<br>
      Honor H and Emilia D, Troop 47307
    </div>
   <div class="projecttext">
    For this project, we studied energy and conservation of energy.  We learned about different types of power plants and how to build simple electrical circuits.  We designed a Take Action program to help people waste less energy over the holidays by using timers and turning off decorations when they were not in use, and distributed information about this project at our school.

     Cadette "Breathe" Journey, Oct 2023<br>
      Valerie H, Troop 47307
    </div>
   <div class="projecttext">
    For this project, I monitored the air quality reports during the California Wildfires of 2023 and researched how wildfires many states away can affect air pollution.  I took photos in our location of the haze created by wildfires, and for my Take Action project I started an email information chain about the effects of deforestation on air quality.

      Silver Award - "No Straws Spring" - May 2023<br>
      Valerie H, Troop 47307
    </div>
   <div class="projecttext">
     This project was about the environmental harm caused by single use plastic straws.  In order to earn this award, Valerie researched the harm caused by single use plastic straws, met with graduate students at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign to talk about advances in plastic decomposition processes, created a website and a video on youtube, and hosted a booth at the Earth Day Expo in Park Ridge, IL.<br><br>

     Brownie "Brownie Quest" Journey, Mar 2023<br>
      Honor H, Troop 47307
    </div>
   <div class="projecttext">
    This project involved learning about myself, my family, and my community.  I learned about my family history and looked at some special items that had been passed down over the years, made some special family recipes, and then looked out to my community as a whole and what I could do to improve it.  I chose a Take Action project of writing to the city council about carpenter bees in the city park sandboxes and how to help reduce their presence.
